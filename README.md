# Respectify!

Respectify! is software that takes an opinionated approach to political correctness.

Between politicians, news journalists, and internet commenters, the country is
abuzz with "political correctness." Is it a powerful form of censorship, or
is it just a moral framing that values the respect of all people? Regardless of
your opinion, the furor will continue!

A few years ago, Neil Gaiman [made the observation](http://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/post/43087620460/i-was-reading-a-book-about-interjections-oddly) that often
"political correctness" was used to blame for not being able to treat other
people with respect.

I laughed out loud! I did find it enlightening! Instead of feeling a tiny bit
sad and angry every time I read something about being "political correct", now
I too smile and feel oddly happy. I want to share this feeling with you, and not
just by hoping you imagine such a world, I want you to see it so I made you this
Chrome Extension.


## Frequently Asked Questions

> Ok, that was fun but how do I turn this damn thing off?

Just visit your <a href="chrome://extensions/">extensions preferences</a>
(Window > Extensions) or by typing `chrome://extensions/` into your browser and
find Respectify and uncheck the "Enabled" box, or click the trash can to remove
it completely.

> Will installing this steal all my personal information?

Nope! See below for more details.

> Thats not what "Politically Correct" even means you pansy leftist SJW!

But it's *funny*. If it doesn't bring you joy, don't use it!


## How Chrome Extensions work

An installed Chrome extension can run code on every page that you visit. This
can be a little scary if you don't know exactly what that code is doing or don't
trust the developer. This is the primary motivation for including an open source
and documented [source code](https://github.com/leebyron/respectify/blob/master/contentScript.js)!

If you're interested in building your own Chrome extension, check out their
[developer documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) and feel free
to use this as an example.

When your extension is ready, you can zip it up with `zip -x ".*" -x "**/.*" -r respecify.zip .` and
submit it to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard).
